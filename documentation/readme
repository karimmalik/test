okay i like to say something.
first, i started to finish this task from monday. from thursday until sunday i have an appoitment.
second, i want to be honest, some of the code i get from stackoverflow and github. for example : im never using framework for backend and frontend at the same time. so i start the project from github source which already contains react + spring.

to start this application you just need to start the application from /Reactjs-RestAPI/src/main/java/com/demo/config/ReactAndRestApp.java and start using java application


thankyou for your time, i hope you have a nice lovely day!

sincerely,
R. Karim Malik
